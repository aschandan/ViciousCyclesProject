               I have delivered on the mockup that was stated and talked about. 
               Also noted, I have added accessibility via alt text within the images, 
               and responsiveness to allow the webpage to be viewed on multiple devices. 
               I believe I have achieved an attractive color scheme that fits well within the context of the designated logo; 
               however I am more than willing to change the color scheme to sport a more ‘vicious’ design. 
               Reds were within my mind in regards of applying to the website. 
               I have filled the webpage with text provided to me and gained from the interview. 
               The photo used helps provide or benefits the sum of text that I have selected from the information given. 
               The layout used here would be great for breaking down and understanding of what is going on within the site. 
               The plan from here would be to section of each part via separate webpages but however to include sub-sections 
               that would befitting to the are at hand. I created a modern aesthetic as well that portrays the current befits 
               the trend that is upon us now. With the current layout being used, it would work well with what was stated in 
               regards of “Allow(ing) for consumers / customers to explore and see new and upcoming bikes with add-ons and other accessories 
               within the website. Bikes will be the main stay of the website” (Amandeep Design Brief). The layout would also provide 
               efficiency in terms of adding and removing content as provided to fulfill any future promises and upkeep. 
               I believe that large sums of text would be unnecessary until required for more elaborate parts of the pages, 
               as noted on the home page. The home page should be welcoming enough and not to blast a large sum of information to users. 
               There is a very small amount of SEO included, however more is needed to make it more appropriate for internet searching purposes.
